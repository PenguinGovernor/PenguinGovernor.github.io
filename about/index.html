<h1 id="hi-there">Hi there</h1>

<p>My name is Jorge Henriquez and I‚Äôm a third-year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering">computer engineering</a> student at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>. I am passionate about technology and I strive to be nothing less than the best programmer I can be. Tech has certainly changed my world for the better and I‚Äôm certain that it can do even more amazing feats for humanity.</p>

<p>But when I‚Äôm not hacking on the command line, or drowning in homework assignments, I try to find the time to improve myself and my workflow. Whether it be meditating with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Puddicombe">Andy Puddicombe</a> or learning productivity tips from <a href="https://twitter.com/TomFrankly">Thomas Frank</a> I try to do a little of everything.</p>

<p>As of this writing I‚Äôm currently a huge fan of  the Go programming language. It has made me love programming again with its simple but intuitive syntax. But even though has Go has captured my heart (üêπ‚ù§) I‚Äôm certainly no stranger to good ol&rsquo; C/C++. I&rsquo;m also quite familiar with JavaScript and some of its derivatives (namely Dart, which was used to write an app using Flutter) .</p>

<p>I‚Äôm currently looking for an internship opportunity so if you ever want to learn more about me and qualifications feel free to to head on over to the <a href="/showcase">showcase</a> to check out some of my projects and if you‚Äôre <em>really</em> interested you can find my resume over at the <a href="/docs">docs</a> section.</p>

<p>But anyways that‚Äôs enough about me, for now at least, ‚Äòtil next time!</p>
