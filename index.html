	<title>Hi Jorge! 🐧</title>

		<main><h1>Hi, I&rsquo;m Jorge! 👋</h1>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rPmoWLC.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Welcome to my website!
As you can see it&rsquo;s rather simple, and that is on purpose!
My website has taken its design cues from <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a> and I love it.
Also, if you&rsquo;ve noticed all the famous engineers have rather simple websites, <a href="http://herpolhode.com/rob/">Rob Pike</a> and <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/">Ryan Dahl</a>, for example. So maybe this website is foreshadowing a bit.
A boy can dream right?
But anyways&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Jorge!
I&rsquo;m a recent Computer Engineering (with a concentration in Computer Systems) graduate from the <a href="https://catalog.ucsc.edu/Current/General-Catalog/Academic-Units/Baskin-School-of-Engineering/Computer-Science-and-Engineering/Computer-Engineering-BS">University of California Santa Cruz</a>.
I love computers and I love building systems from scratch! 💻🧡</p>

<p>My favorite technologies include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> (I hope this one is obvious 🐹)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C/C++</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system">Embedded programming</a> for the win! 🔧)</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (Although, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> may knock this off with the introduction of <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC">GRPC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">GruvBox Dark</a> &ndash; But you knew that already <em>(;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>And here are a couple of projects that I&rsquo;m super proud to show off!</p>

<h2>Senior Design Project</h2>

<p>For my senior design project we built a <em>Bus Monitoring Through WiFi Probing</em> system to count the number of passengers on our (overly populated) campus shuttle busses.
We managed to accomplish this with a couple of Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s, WiFi antennas, and ingenuity!</p>

<p>This project was my fist foray into GRPC and unreliable networks.
I&rsquo;m proud of my team&rsquo;s work and I&rsquo;m happy to show it off!</p>

<p>You can find all of our work at our <a href="https://github.com/UCSC-CSE123">GitHub organization</a>.</p>

<p>You can also find our design document on my LinkedIn that&rsquo;s linked below (pun intended).</p>

<h2>The Babel Sandbox</h2>

<p>For my last internship at the <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">MLH Fellowship</a> a team of fellows, our mentor, and myself put together <a href="https://babelsandbox.com/">babelsandbox.com</a>.
It&rsquo;s a sandbox for developers to try out <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> configurations and plugins to see how they interact with each other!</p>

<p>This project taught me how to work on the front and back ends; It also showed how a formalized JSON API schema facilitates development!
Many thanks to my mentor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnnngs/">Ian</a> for helping us build this and thanks to the awesome fellows who made that internship so much fun!</p>
